== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What does this plugin do ? = 
This plugin provides the ability to add the like and dislike buttons for WordPress native posts.

= I have enabled the plugin but like and dislike icons are not being displayed. What may be the reason ? =
Our plugin uses the_content filter to append like and dislike icons . So if your active theme's posts template doesn't use the_content filter to display posts content then our plugin won't be able to display like and dislike icons.

= Is there any hooks available to extend the plugin ? = 
Our plugin does contains many actions and filters which are described inside the Help Section

= I want to display in the post detail template. Do you have a custom function? = 
We do have a shortcode [posts_like_dislike] which can also be used as custom function through `<?php echo do_shortcode('[posts_like_dislike]');?>`
